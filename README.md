Welcome! Thanks for coming.


## How to participate

[Install git][git] if you haven't already.

The first wave of challenges will be interacting with this repository.
**Complete the challenges below** in the order they appear.

Don't worry about making a mistake. **All edits will be local**,
so they won't affect anyone else. Remember, git is distributed :wink:

If you get stuck, **raise your hand** and a mentor will be over to help.

Let's begin!
